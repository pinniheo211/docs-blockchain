          In the dynamic field of blockchain technology, security remains
          paramount, with the quest for robust consensus mechanisms and
          resilient defenses against attacks being perpetual. Enter Proof of
          Mobile (PoM), a groundbreaking innovation introduced by NOW
          Blockchain, poised to revolutionize security through the collaborative
          power of mobile devices. We will explore the concept of Proof of
          Mobile, jumping into its significance, mechanics, and potential
          implications for the future of decentralized networks, as well as how
          it can bolster blockchain security and thwart malicious attacks

            How Proof of Mobile Works?
          </h1>
          <ul className="list-decimal flex flex-col gap-3 mt-5">
            <li>
              Device Participation: Users participate in the consensus process
              by installing a PoM-enabled mobile application on their devices.
              These applications utilize the device's processing power to
              perform cryptographic computations and validate transactions on
              the blockchain network.
            </li>
            <li>
              Transaction Validation: When a new transaction is initiated on the
              network, PoM-enabled mobile devices receive the transaction data
              and independently verify its validity. Once verified, the
              transaction is added to the blockchain, and consensus is reached
              among participating devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              Incentive Mechanisms: To incentivize participation, users may be
              rewarded with native tokens or other incentives for contributing
              their device's computational resources to the consensus process.
              This encourages widespread adoption and engagement within the PoM
              ecosystem.
            </li>
            <li>
              Security Measures: PoM employs cryptographic techniques and
              encryption protocols to ensure the security and integrity of
              transactions. The decentralized nature of mobile device
              participation enhances network resilience and mitigates the risk
              of centralized control or manipulation.

            Advantages of Proof of Mobile:
          </h1>
          <ul className="list-decimal flex flex-col gap-3 mt-5">
            <li>
              Accessibility: PoM enables broader participation in blockchain
              consensus, allowing anyone with a smartphone or tablet to
              contribute to network security and validation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Efficiency: By leveraging existing mobile infrastructure, PoM
              reduces energy consumption and environmental impact compared to
              traditional consensus mechanisms like PoW, which require
              significant computational resources.
            </li>
            <li>
              Scalability: The vast network of mobile devices worldwide provides
              inherent scalability to PoM-enabled blockchain networks,
              facilitating increased transaction throughput and network
              expansion.
            </li>
            <li>
              Decentralization: PoM promotes decentralization by distributing
              consensus authority across a diverse array of mobile devices,
              preventing any single entity from exerting undue influence over
              the network.
