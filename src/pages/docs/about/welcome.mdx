# Introducing NOW Blockchain

Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across a network of computers. Each transaction is stored in a `block` which is then linked to the previous block, forming a chain. This decentralized nature ensures transparency and security.

Every computer in the network must agree upon each new block and the chain as a whole. These computers are known as "nodes". Nodes ensure everyone interacting with the blockchain has the same data. To accomplish this distributed agreement, blockchains need a consensus mechanism.

## Vision

At NOW Blockchain, our vision is to merge blockchain technology with the inherent security of mobile devices, creating a new standard of trust. We`re committed to building a robust ecosystem where individuals transact with confidence, knowing their assets are safeguarded by our innovative approach to security.
